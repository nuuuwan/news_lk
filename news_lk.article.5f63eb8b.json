    "\" After concluding the vaccination of the majority of the people, the government will be able to restore normalcy in every field including the school education and tourism. Judging from the efficiency of the vaccination programe , I am hopeful that the inter provincial travel restrictions could be lifted soon. Political rivals were under the impression that the country\u2019s economy would be totally ruined and the development activities would grind to a halt bringing about the collapse of the government . They were sadly mistaken. The President and the Prime Minister have been able to face this challenge and to save the country\" Minister Namal Rajapakse said.",
