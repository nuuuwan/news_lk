  "paragraphs": [
    "Tourism sector employees have reached their breaking point after grappling with the hardships stemming from the pandemic and the Easter Sunday attack, thus it is imperative for the government to look into their grievances without any further delay, the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) said.",
    "Speaking to Mirror Business, THASL President Sanath Ukwatte said employees attached to the hard-hit sector have reached a dead end with no steady means of income.",
    "Despite the repeated pleas made to the government to offer a compensation payment for employees, and restructure debt of businesses engaged in tourism, the industry has yet to receive any response to the proposals made.",
    "\"The employees of the industry have reached a breaking point. They have been trying to make ends meet for nearly two years. But they cannot any more. Their personal loans are being recovered at a time when they have no income. Their vehicles are being seized due to non-payment of lease. What else can be expected,\" Ukwatte told Mirror Business.",
    "In an effort to ease the mounting burden on the industry and the workforce it supports, Ukwatte reiterated the need to allow cross provincial travel, at least for those who are fully vaccinated.",
    "\"We understand that we welcome tourists at the moment. But we have locals who we can cater to. For that, the relevant authorities need to lift the travel ban between provinces for those who are fully vaccinated. We can start there,\" stressed the THASL head."
