    "snippet": "The winding roads of Colombo - Badulla kept stretching forward, each second further and further away from the hustle and bustle of the metropolitan. The climb was steep and challenging as 99 buses kept flying as they wish. Despite the challenges of the roads similar to any other place in the country, the surrounding was breath-taking. Gigantic mountain ranges kept appearing one after the other, making me feel like a Lilliput in\u00a0Gulliver's Travels. While I was utterly blown away by the magical environment of Belihuloya, we managed to reach the small, quiet Pambahinna town. After taking the turn from the clock tower that governs the town with patient eyes, it was the road that took me to one of the most significant universities on the island. Such were the experiences I received on the first day I visited the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. My lexicon fails miserably to describe the amazement I received by walking through the main gates of the University for the very first time, and it is a memory that will last forever. Surrounded by natural beauty, unparalleled to any other place in the country, stands the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka stronger than ever before. Since its inception, Sabaragamuwa University has been paramount in the tertiary education of this country. Addressing the dire requirements of the trying times in 1991, the University was formed under the prevailing government as an Affiliated University College (SAUC). Recognising the potential for expansion of Higher Education in the country, the University was transformed into a fully-fledged university and went down in history as the 12th national University of the country. Decades later, the University now comprises eight faculties that span across various disciplines, including the Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Technology, and Faculty of Graduate Studies. Staying true to the University vision, \"to be an internationally acclaimed centre of excellence in higher learning producing dynamic leaders and nation builders to guide the destiny of Sri Lanka\", the constant focus is placed on knowledge generation and dissemination with the expectation of creating a lasting impact on society. The University consists of knowledgeable, amiable, and capable academic staff who are also young at heart. They are stoic and resilient in the face of dire calamities. The world came to a standstill with the unforeseen pandemic that engulfed every nook and corner of the world. The pearl of the Indian Ocean was no exception to this impending doom and dark times of humanity as the heartless virus invaded our country as well. Things started to fall apart, slowly but surely, allowing us to realise the power and indifference of the virus over the safety and normalcy of everyday life. Yet, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka stands stronger than ever despite the challenging times. Arundhati Roy views the pandemic as \"a portal, a gateway between one world and the next\". This is more or less the perception of the academics of Sabaragamuwa University as they are inspired to go forward fulfilling the country's requirements despite the multifarious challenges faced by many countries. As a true testament to the perpetual interest in research, the University is getting ready to hold its 8th International Conference of Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka (ICSUSL) from 1st to 3rd December 2021. The International Conference of Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka (ICSUSL) has a proud history, as the maiden conference was held in 2006 under the theme of \"Issues and Challenges of the 21st century\". The conference was held at Belihuloya University premises, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the young University. Numerous distinguished personnel graced the occasion, and it certainly caught the eye of many researchers and the general public. It was a novel experience for some and created a significant impact on the academic arena of the country. The conference enabled delegates to network and benefit from contacts with national and international visitors who had broader understandings of the global issues and challenges of the 21st century. Henceforth, the International Conference of Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka (ICSUSL) has been a milestone of each year and definitely one of the most anticipated events of the academic calendar. Up until the 4th symposium, it was named the \"International Symposium\". However, from the 5th conference onwards, the name was altered as the International Conference of Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka (ICSUSL) and remained thus far. Each conference focused on a specific theme, especially a timely and relevant topic in the milieu, which enabled the origination and dissemination of pertinent research output that enriched the academic field and society in return. Each keynote speaker was carefully chosen and enabled delegates to incorporate the thoughts of eminent national and international scholars. The first conference I was able to witness was the 06th ICSUSL 2017 held from 3rd to 5th May 2017 at the Grand Kandyan Hotel, Kandy. The purpose of the conference was to encourage the academics and to enhance their research and knowledge dissemination while benchmarking the contribution and successful journey of Sabaragamuwa University. The theme of the conference was \"Flourishing Knowledge beyond Contemporary Paradigm\" which envisaged science, research, and knowledge-based paradigmatic change in problem-solving and developmental interventions. Interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary dialogues and interactions of researchers and participants at the 6th ICSUSL enlightened new order in sustainable development, science, and knowledge-based society. The conference was further enriched by choosing an appropriate venue in a world-renowned heritage city, Kandy, and including post-conference tours to the mesmerizing highlands of Sri Lanka. It was indeed a testament and marked the pinnacle of one of the highest achievements the University could achieve, and I was blessed to witness such grandeur. When it was doubtful whether it was possible to surpass the 6th ICSUSL, the 7th conference managed to achieve that in style. The 7th ICSUSL was held from 14th to 15th November 2019 at Belihuloya, Sri Lanka. The conference was organized under the theme \"Frontier Technologies for a Sustainable Future\" reflected the passion and commitment to promoting the exchange of state-of-the-art scientific knowledge in a wide array of disciplines within the purview of our teaching and research. While witnessing the dawn of an era featured by frontier technological and nanotechnology, it was crucial to ensure that these technologies worked for society, the economy as well as the environment, if we were to achieve sustainable development. These challenges were effectively and efficiently addressed, ensuring the birth of novel experiences and knowledge for the benefit of the greater good. Notwithstanding the trials and stipulations of the current day and age, the 8th International Conference of Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka is just around the corner. As a continuation of its proud legacy, the 8th ICSUSL is scheduled to be held in December 2021 under the theme \"Bridging Knowledge and Experience to Combat Global Challenges\". The conference will serve as a platform for bringing together researchers from a variety of disciplines to disseminate scientific findings, exchanging knowledge, and finding practical solutions to current issues and global challenges. Being one of the key events of the yearlong celebrations of the University's 25th Anniversary, the conference will extend the efforts of SUSL in strengthening communities and their knowledge systems. The upcoming conference will be unique and exciting for all since it is intended to function purely as a virtual experience, which proves, yet again, its appropriateness. Research activities of the highest calibre, needless to say, add value, status, and glamour to the University's role. Research, while seeing to the amalgamation of academic minds and findings, caters to nation-building, causes internationally significant changes, and thus improves the quality of lives of mankind. Consequently, the pre-conference workshops that are to be held would, most certainly, provide ample opportunities for young researchers, academics, delegates, and undergraduates to reap numerous benefits and add more colour to their profiles. The dire necessity of these trying times coupled with the rapid pace of technological advancement will produce the most irreplaceable and memorable days in December, bringing new aspirations towards a brighter tomorrow.",
