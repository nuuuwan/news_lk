What tangible action have been taken since then to realise what was agreed upon? The Pakistani High Commission has constantly engaged with all relevant stake holders including the Sri Lankan President, the Prime Minister, the Cabinet ministers, the government officials and the business community to enhance the bilateral cooperation and economic collaboration between our two friendly countries.

The visit was a success and created goodwill between the peoples of the two countries.",

    "Q Pakistan stood by Sri Lanka in Geneva against the UNHRC (United Nations Human Rights Council) resolution. In Pakistan\u2019s point of view, how will the situation unfold for Sri Lanka? We have always stood by Sri Lanka at the UNHRC because we believe that any solution to a country\u2019s problems cannot be effective unless the country in question is taken on board. We hope that the countries which brought the resolution as well as those that supported it should realise that Sri Lanka is a sovereign country which should be trusted to implement effective domestic mechanisms for reconciliation. We are also hopeful that the Sri Lanka government will visibly ensure that it has the trust and confidence of all communities and ethnicities in the country since only then, it will be able to effectively face International accountability challenges like the one at the UNHRC.",
    "Q The Pakistani Prime Minister mentioned that the CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) could be used by Sri Lankan businessmen to access markets in the Central Asian region. How feasible is this idea? Is there any progress in this regard? As you know that Central Asia is the largest landlocked area of the world which has suffered from poor access to global markets due to its geography. If Sri Lanka plans to access the Central Asian markets, it would need a secure land route and Pakistan can provide exactly that to Sri Lanka through CPEC. Sri Lanka and Pakistan are already trading partners and have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). So, Sri Lanka\u2019s trade with the CARs (Central Asian Region) can be very much feasible through Pakistan. The Prime Minister made this offer. Pakistan is receptive to Sri Lankan proposals in this regard. Nevertheless, the evolving situation in Afghanistan will have its impact on this initiative. Pakistan is hopeful that with the help of international community, the warring factions in Afghanistan will be able to peacefully resolve their domestic differences leading to a stable Afghanistan in the future.",

Unique selling proposition of the Port City of Colombo, cost advantage, investment opportunities, employment opportunities, infrastructures with international standards, 100 percent foreign ownership and relaxed exchange control regulations in the zone will give edge over other regional hubs and especially for South Asian investors.
