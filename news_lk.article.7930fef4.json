  "paragraphs": [
    "Sri Lanka is continuing to explore avenues to make the destination increasingly easier for tourists, and the latest is to allow vaccinated travelers who have not travelled from restricted countries, to forgo the second PCR test after arrival.",
    "The Ministry of Health (MoH) this week amended further the mandatory measures to be followed by foreign arrivals entering the country.",
    "According to the revised guideline, travelers who have received both vaccination doses for COVID-19 do not have to undergo a PCR test on the seventh day provided that the on arrival PCR result is negative.",
    "However, unvaccinated children between the ages two and eighteen, accompanying fully vaccinated parents have to undergo the day seven PCR test.",
    "The new measures have also made it mandatory for travelers above the age of two arriving into the county to carry a negative PCR report that is done within 72 hours of disembarkation.",
    "Meanwhile, those entering the country with a tourist visa with a travel history, including transit in the past 14 days, from India, and South African countries will not be allowed to disembark in Sri Lanka until further notice."
