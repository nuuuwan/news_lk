    "Samagi Jana Balawegaya(SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne said his party would not be able to work with those found guilty of child trafficking, child labour and sexual abuse of children.",
    "Mr. Wickramaratne told a press conference that the policy of his party is to denounce all forms of harassment on children.",
    "\"SJB is a party but we work with several political parties in Parliament such as the SLMC led by Rauff Hakeem and the All Ceylon Makkal Congress(ACMC) led by Rishad Bathiudeen. We have come to an agreement with regard to several issues. There may be issues with other parties. Those parties may have their own policies over some aspects. However if any one breaks a policy which our party stands for, we cannot continue to work with them. However when it comes to the death of a minor at Bathiudeen\u2019s house ,the matter should be proven in a court of law,\" the MP said .",
    "\"Those who are engaged in child abuse should be dealt with irrespective of their positions,\" he said.(Yohan Perera)"
