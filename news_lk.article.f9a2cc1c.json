    "Cabinet spokesman, Mass Media Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said that a probe will be initiated on the alleged visit to Japan by State Ministers Thenuka Widanagamage, D.V.Chanaka and Roshan Ranasinghe, to witness the Olympic games.",
    "Responding to a journalist at today\u2019s weekly Cabinet news briefing, the Media Minister said the probe will look into the purpose of the visit to Japan by three State Ministers in the entourage of Sports Minister Namal Rajapaksa who was officially participating in the Olympic games festival and also the alleged failure to display the Sri Lankan National flag at the opening ceremony.",
    "A journalist questioned the rationale of the merry making visit of the three State Ministers together with Minister Rajapaksa at a time when Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa had requested to minimise government expenses as much as possible.",
    "\"My understanding is that they have been sponsored by a certain NGO and the government has not spent a rupee on their tour. However,I agree that an inquiry should be launched to reveal the truth,\" Minister Rambukwella added.(Sandun A Jayasekera)"
